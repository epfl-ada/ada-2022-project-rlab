## Abstract

Why we do it, what story do we want to tell?

## Research questions

Questions adressed during the project

## Proposed additional dataset

* **AD1: [Population by national and/or ethnic group, sex and urban/rural residence](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode:26)** : 
This dataset will provide us with base informations about ethnicities and sex representation in each country. We will only scrap the following attributes: "Country or Area", "Sex", "National and/or ethnic group", "Value".

## Methods

Methods used, which comparisons. What has already been done (put pictures here)

Bullshit timelines with a few milestones

## Team organisation

## Remaining questions

Questions to the TAs: Are we following the right path, is our story a good story, enough storyful and storylike
Methds are okay, enough data analysis ?
