When you were little, watching the television, were you able to identify yourself with some characters? Did they inspire you to become the person you are today? 

Probably so. Children can often find themselves in movie characters, and these characters can have a significant impact on their self-brand ([1](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/32/1/119/1796308?login=true#89509484)). Studies have shown that movies can influence a child's gender identity ([2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-020-01127-z)), moral foundation ([3](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248928)), ethnic identity ([4](https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josi.12104)), sexual identity ([5](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J086v15n04_02)), and many other aspects of their self-representation. 

Here we looked into the lack of representation in the movie industry and how they can limit the options that children see for themselves in the future.
