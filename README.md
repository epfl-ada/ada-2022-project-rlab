# Gender differences in movies
Rlab - P2 Milestone

## Abstract

The movie industry has received much criticism in the last few years due to poor representation, which impacts children's development. If children cannot find themselves in movie characters' it may impact their future self-esteem. Moreover, gender stereotypes have an impact on children's personality development. It is meaningful to acknowledge the lack of representation in the movie industry in order to improve it.
This specific study analyzes sex and ethnic representation in the movie industry. Additionally, an exploration of the representation evolution across time is present to determine if the movie industry is trying to better reflect our society, which would positively impact children's development.  

## Research questions

In what extent is the film industry displaying an accurate representation of today’s society?
Answering such large question can be done by dividing it in a subset of questions:

A) Are the different ethnicities and sex as represented as they are in real life? 
B) If there is a difference in representation, where does it occur most? In which geographical area? In which movie genre?
C) How is the representation evolving with the increase of box office?

## Proposed additional dataset

* **AD1: [Population by national and/or ethnic group, sex and urban/rural residence](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode:26)** : 
This dataset will provide us with base informations about ethnicities and sex representation in each country. We will only scrap the following attributes: "Country or Area", "Sex", "National and/or ethnic group", "Value".

## Perhaps a title

- pre</br> 17th century
- Origins of coffee
- The modern version of roasted coffee originated in Arabia. During the 13th century, coffee was extremely popular with the Muslim community for its stimulant powers, which proved useful during long prayer sessions. By parching and boiling the coffee beans, rendering them infertile, the Arabs were able to corner the market on coffee crops. In fact, tradition says that not a single coffee plant existed outside of Arabia or Africa until the 1600s, when Baba Budan, an Indian pilgrim, left Mecca with fertile beans fastened to a strap across his abdomen. Baba’s beans resulted in a new and competitive European coffee trade.

- 17th century
- Europe and coffee
- In 1616, the Dutch founded the first European-owned coffee estate in Sri Lanka, then Ceylon, then Java in 1696. The French began growing coffee in the Caribbean, followed by the Spanish in Central America and the Portuguese in Brazil. European coffee houses sprang up in Italy and later France, where they reached a new level of popularity. Now, it is de _rigueur_ for Parisians to indulge in a cup of coffee and a baguette or croissant at the numerous coffee cafes throughout Paris.
