When you were little, watching the television, were you able to identify yourself with some characters? Did they inspire you to become the person you are today? 

It is important for children to see themselves represented in the media they consume, including movies. When children do not see themselves represented in movies, it can limit their perception of what is possible for them in the future. This lack of representation can also have negative effects on a child's self-esteem and self-concept([1](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/32/1/119/1796308?login=true#89509484)). Studies have shown that movies can influence a child's gender identity ([2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-020-01127-z)), moral foundation ([3](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248928)), ethnic identity ([4](https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josi.12104)), sexual identity ([5](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J086v15n04_02)), and many other aspects of their self-representation. For example, a child who does not see characters that look like them or share their experiences may feel like they are not important or valued. On the other hand, seeing characters that they can relate to can help children feel seen and valued, and can also provide them with role models to look up to. In order for children to have a diverse range of options for their future selves, it is important for the movie industry to provide representation for all groups of people.
