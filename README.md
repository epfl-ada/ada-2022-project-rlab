# Gender differences in movies
Rlab - P2 Milestone

## Abstract

The movie industry has received much criticism in the last few years due to poor representation, which impacts children's development. If children cannot find themselves in movie characters' it may impact their future self-esteem. Moreover, gender stereotypes have an impact on children's personality development. It is meaningful to acknowledge the lack of representation in the movie industry in order to improve it.
This specific study analyzes sex and ethnic representation in the movie industry. Additionally, an exploration of the representation evolution across time is present to determine if the movie industry is trying to better reflect our society, which would positively impact children's development.  

## Research questions

In what extent is the film industry displaying an accurate representation of today’s society?
Answering such large question can be done by dividing it in a subset of questions:

A) Are the different ethnicities and sex as represented as they are in real life? 
B) If there is a difference in representation, where does it occur most? In which geographical area? In which movie genre?
C) How is the representation evolving with the increase of box office?

## Proposed additional dataset

* **AD1: [Population by national and/or ethnic group, sex and urban/rural residence](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode:26)** : 
This dataset will provide us with base informations about ethnicities and sex representation in each country. We will only scrap the following attributes: "Country or Area", "Sex", "National and/or ethnic group", "Value".

## Proposed timeline

    {{% event title="Data Analysis" year="30th November"%}}
   We will analyse our data further. More precisely we will normalize our data to be able to compare representations between movies. We will as well statistically analyse our results to be able to get correlations.

   Additional analysis will be done in correlation with the most significant analysis to support them. While doing so we will start working on our data story.

## Remaining questions

Questions to the TAs: Are we following the right path, is our story a good story, enough storyful and storylike
Methds are okay, enough data analysis ?
